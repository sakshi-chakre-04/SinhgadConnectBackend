# SinhgadConnect Backend - Changes Made & Dependencies Added

## Package.json Scripts Configuration

Updated the npm scripts to properly handle development and production environments:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production node server",
  "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development nodemon server"
}
```

**Changes:**
- Added `cross-env` to ensure environment variables work across different operating systems
- `start` script: Sets NODE_ENV to production and runs server with node
- `dev` script: Sets NODE_ENV to development and runs server with nodemon for auto-restart

## Environment-Based Logging

Implemented conditional logging based on environment:

```javascript
// in development mode, use morgan for logging
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  app.use(morgan('dev'));
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Enables detailed HTTP request logging only in development mode
- Improves performance in production by disabling verbose logging
- Uses morgan middleware for formatted request logs

## Server Startup Configuration

Enhanced server startup with environment-aware messaging:

```javascript
// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server is running in ${process.env.NODE_ENV} mode on port ${PORT}`);
  // console.log(`ðŸ“± Environment: ${process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'}`);
});
```

**Features:**
- Displays current environment mode (development/production)
- Shows the port number the server is running on
- Includes emoji for better visual identification in logs

## Dependencies Added

### Morgan
```javascript
const morgan = require('morgan'); // HTTP request logger middleware
```

**Installation:** `npm install morgan`

**Purpose:**
- Logs HTTP requests in development mode
- Provides detailed request information (method, URL, status, response time)
- Helps with debugging and monitoring API calls

## Summary of Changes

1. **Environment Management**: Proper NODE_ENV handling for development vs production
2. **Logging**: Conditional HTTP request logging with morgan
3. **Scripts**: Cross-platform compatible npm scripts
4. **Dependencies**: Added morgan for development logging

These changes improve the development experience and ensure proper environment separation between development and production modes.
